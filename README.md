# vortex-simulator
This a personal project that is to simulate a proper vortex in a certain condition of volume of water. An addition to this would be to create a water-sprout as well. This will be done using vscode and blender. A physical model will be completed when digital version is done. This will be introduced later with a material, design, and cost analysis. \
\
A final version of the product will be presented in a game engine running on html, JS, and CSS. 

The language the code will be written in is undecided as of now. I will experiment with java, JS, and python and see which one is best fit for the practicality of this program.

# Data Analysis:
I will probably use a software to analyze the data acquired from the simulation and display it as an html webpage with JS code that the user can work with and graph data points. This data points will allow the user to work with further calculations involving fluid dynamics/mechanics. \
Data Values: \
1). Pressure (of water and of air) \
2). Volume \
3). Velocity of fluid \
... \
\
Database will be written in SQL.

# Design:
Design of a webpage that allow the user to manipulate and see the data will be implemented via Figma and knowledge of UI with JQuery.
