# vortex-simulator
This a personal project that is to stimulate a proper vortex in a certain condition of volume of water. An addition to this would be to stimulate a water-sprout as well. This will be done using vscode and blender. A physical version will be completed when digital version is done. A final version of the product will be presented in a game engine running on Html, JS, and CSS.
